# Introduction
Malignant tumor, is considered one of the most serious threats to human health. Among numerous causes attributable to tumor, the intra-tumoral heterogeneity (ITH), once ignored, is now thought to have been a key factor contributing to the therapeutic failure. Today, with the rapid development of high-throughput sequencing technologies, sequencing of spatially or temporally distinct tumor regions has begun to uncover the bewildering extent of diversity within tumors. To facilitate the rapid analysis, we present an R package, MesKit, providing comprehensive analysis that are commonly used in cancer genomic ITH studies, including ITH evaluation, enrichment, signature, clone evolution analysis, also allowing visualizing phylogenetic trees.
