#### **Introduction**  
Malignant tumor, is considered one of the most serious threats to human health. Among numerous causes attributable to tumor, the intratumor heterogeneity(ITH), once ignored, is now thought to have been a key factor contributing to the therapeutic failure.
Today, with the rapid development of high-throughput sequencing technologies, cancer evolution and ITH have attracted increasing attention in the cancer research field. To facilitate the rapid analysis, we developed MesKit R package. MesKit provids comprehensive analysis and visualization modules that are commonly in used in studying WES data from multiregion sampling, including assessing ITH, clonal, pathway, signature analysis etc. 


#### **With this MesKit's Shiny APP:**  

* Evaluate the intratumoral heterogeneity(ITH) of multiple samples from each patient.
* Identify founder and progressor mutations for functional analysis.
* Peform clonal analysis.
* Peform mutation signature analysis to figure out the asscociated cellular processes and external agents.
* Track tumor evolution by constructing phylogenetic tree.
